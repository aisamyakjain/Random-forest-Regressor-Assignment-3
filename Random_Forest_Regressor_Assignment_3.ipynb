    "Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The main differences between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensemble vs. Single Model: Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble algorithm that combines multiple decision trees, while Decision Tree Regressor is a single decision tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Overfitting: Random Forest Regressor reduces overfitting by averaging the predictions of multiple trees, whereas Decision Tree Regressor is prone to overfitting due to its ability to capture complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Variance: Random Forest Regressor typically has lower variance compared to Decision Tree Regressor because it averages the predictions of multiple trees, leading to more stable and robust predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interpretability: Decision Tree Regressor provides interpretable decision rules, making it easier to understand the relationship between features and predictions. Random Forest Regressor, on the other hand, is less interpretable due to the ensemble nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Training Time: Random Forest Regressor may take longer to train compared to Decision Tree Regressor since it involves building and combining multiple decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between the two depends on the specific problem, the need for interpretability, and the trade-off between model complexity and performance."
